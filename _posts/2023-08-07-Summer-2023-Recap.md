We had a wonderful summer in the lab, full of fun and science! We were delighted to welcome two talented interns who both presented their work well at poster sessions. Well done Precious and Maggie! We also organized the first-ever lab dessert contest, which was won by the delicious lab-themed pie made by Kaite (see the photo above!). We shared our work with the scientific community at several local and national conferences. And last but not least, we added a new lab member to our team: Devon, who joined us in May. We are very excited to have her join as a PhD student in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology PhD program.
