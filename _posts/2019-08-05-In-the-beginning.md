The Cornett Lab is open for science. The equipment is on the way to fill this beautiful lab space. The only missing ingredient is a curious team ready to tackle lysine methylation signaling. We are currently looking for a research technician and a postdoc. Keep your eye open for advertisements to be posted soon, and if you are interested, feel free to send your CV and a statement of your research experience and interests to Evan (evcorn@iu.edu).
