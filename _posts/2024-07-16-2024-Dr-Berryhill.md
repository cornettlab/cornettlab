Christine became the first PhD student from the lab to defend! She gave an amazing seminar and we had a blast celebrating all she has accomplished. Christine will move on to a postdoc position with Dr. Steve Angus at IUSM, but she will be immortalized in the lab forever. In her honor we have renamed our mass spec computer workstation in her name and she has hidden several pictures of herself throughout the lab! Congratulations Chrsitine!
