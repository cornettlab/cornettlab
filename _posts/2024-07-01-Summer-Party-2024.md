The Cornett Lab gathered for the 2nd annual dessert contest and summer party! There was an impressive display of creativity and nerdy science-themed desserts that tasted as good as they looked! Competition was tight, but Christine took home the trophy for her K-OPL-inspired heatmap dessert. Congratulations, Christine!
