Jocelyne and Christine attended the 70th American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics last week and made the lab proud! Christine presented our labâ€™s efforts to optimize workflows for the global detection of lysine methylation using mass spectrometry. This was the first Cornett Lab poster at an in-person conference! They came back with a lot of new ideas for their projects, new connections, and some awesome conference swag!
